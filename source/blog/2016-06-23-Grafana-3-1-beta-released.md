## Dashboard Repository

Sharing dashboards is something that we wanted to do for a very long time and something that aligns very good with our vision.

- Democratize Metrics ()
- Built Better Together

## Dashboard Urls

Saving the timerange and template variable in the url makes it much easier to share dashboards with others within your organisation.

## Internal metrics

Do you want metrics about view metrics? Ofc you do! In this release we added support for sending metrics about Grafana to graphite.
