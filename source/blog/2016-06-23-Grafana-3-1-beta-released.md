## Dashboard Repository
Its now possible to download and upload dashboards at [Grafana.net](http://grafana.net/dashboards/).

To import a dashboard just go to Dashboard -> Import and you will see the new Import flow.
We have added the possbility to import dashboards directly from grafana.net by entering the url.

Afterwards Grafana will ask you to set some values before the dashboard can be saved to your grafana instance.

If you built some great dashboards, why not share them with the rest of us?

## Dashboard Urls

Saving the timerange and template variable in the url makes it much easier to share dashboards with others within your organisation.

## Internal metrics

Do you want metrics about viewing metrics? Ofc you do! In this release we added support for sending metrics about Grafana to graphite.
You can configure interval and server in the config file.

## Thanks
A big thank you to everyone who helped test and report issues with the beta release.
