## Grafana.net

<img src="/assets/img/blog/v3.0/grafana_net_tour.png">

[Grafana.net](https://grafana.net) offers a central repository where the community can come together to discover, create and
share plugins (data sources, panels, apps) and dashboards.

We are also working on a hosted Graphite-compatible data source that will be optimized for use with Grafana.
It’ll be easy to combine your existing data source(s) with this OpenSaaS option. Finally, Grafana.net can
also be a hub to manage all your Grafana instances. You’ll be able to monitor their health and availability,
perform dashboard backups, and more.
