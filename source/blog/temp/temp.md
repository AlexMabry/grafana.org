### Discover and share dashboards

The main new feature in this release is the ability to export dashboards in more portable format so that
you can share them with others or import them into another Grafana instance without manually
updating data source names or metric prefixes. The import process will now allow you specify
the data sources and metric prefixes that the dashboard requires.

You can discover and share dashboard on [Grafana.net](https://grafana.net). There are already
a number of dashboards there.

You can filter by what data source or collector you use. There are already dashboards available for Graphite, Collectd, Prometheus, and node exporter, AWS CloudWatch, Memcached and Nginx. 

Anyone can share a dashboard on Grafana.net, just sign in and go the profile page and then
the dashboards link in the side nav, then hit the `Upload dashboard` button. Remember to be
very detailed in the dashboard markdown readme section. Describe the dashboard
and every relevant detail & config for the collector you used.

### Dashboard Urls
In Grafana 3.1 the current time range and template variables values are always synced to the URL. This makes it possible to always copy your current
Grafana url to share with a colleague without having to use the Share modal.

### Internal metrics
Do you want metrics about viewing metrics? Of course you do!
In this release we added support for sending metrics about Grafana to graphite.
You can configure interval and server in the config file. There is aready a
dashboard for internal metrics on Grafana.net named [Internal Grafana Stats](https://grafana.net/dashboards/55)
as well as a live demo of [the dashboard](http://play.grafana.org/dashboard/db/internal-grafana-stats) on the play site.
The dashboard has the following graphs:

- Data proxy request times as percentiles
- Data proxy requests / s
- Dashboard search times, load / save
- Logins

### Breaking changes
- **Logging** format have been changed to improve log filtering.
- **Graphite PNG** Graphite PNG support dropped from Graph panel (use Grafana native PNG instead).
- **Migration** No longer possible to import dashboards from 1.x stored in ES or Influx 0.8

### Thanks
A big thanks to all the Grafana users who contribute by submitting PRs, bug reports & feedback!
