#### From the Blogosphere
[**Monitoring Using Prometheus**](https://rahulwa.com/post/monitoring-using-prometheus/): Rahul walks us through all of the necessary pieces to stand up a Prometheus monitoring stack and provides links to a few <a href="https://grafana.com/dashboards/22?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=timeshift_12" target="_blank">pre-made</a> Grafana <a href="https://grafana.com/dashboards/405?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=timeshift_12" target="_blank">dashboards</a> so you can start visualizing those metrics quickly and easily.

[**The Web Performance Team at the Wikimedia Foundation!**](https://www.peterhedenskog.com/blog/2017/05/join-the-web-performance-team-at-wikimedia/): We're fascinated by the number of <a href="https://grafana.wikimedia.org/?orgId=1" target="_blank">dashboards</a> Wikimedia shares publicly. They were recently searching for someone to join their web performance team, and provided a ton of insight into what they collect and why it's important. A really interetsting read.

[**PromCon 2017: Grafana and Prometheus - Carl Bergquist**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDpP1uX_orE): A few issues ago we linked Grafana Labs developer, Carl Bergquist's PromCon 2017 <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NTYA6J7qZNhJlFEzaBOB-jVzVAGS8C5etJflAjXvVec/edit#slide=id.p" target="_blank">slide deck</a>. Now that all the videos are online, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDpP1uX_orE" target="_blank">his presentation</a>, and check out the rest of the videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pr-z8-r1eo&list=PLoz-W_CUquUlnvoEBbqChb7A0ZEZsWSXt" target="_blank">here</a>.

[**Building a LoRaWAN Enabled Bat Detector**](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/building-a-lorawan-enabled-bat-detector): We've seen Batman <a href="https://twitter.com/vpetersson/status/898472680042754048/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3002%2F2017%2F08%2F18%2Ftimeshiftgrafanabuzz-1w-issue-9%2F" target="_blank">pop up</a> a <a href="https://twitter.com/cubeeek/status/900035936553250816/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3002%2F2017%2F08%2F25%2Ftimeshiftgrafanabuzz-1w-issue-10%2F" target="_blank">a few times</a> in graphs recently, but this article is about tracking a different kind of bat â€“ using a custom-built solar powered bat detector and Grafana.

<h4>This week's MVC (Most Valuable Contributor)</h4>

#### Tweet of the Week
We scour Twitter each week to find an interesting/beautiful dashboard and show it off! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monitoringlove?src=hash" target="_blank">#monitoringLove</a>
<p>Nice! Combining different panel types on a dashboard can add more context to your data - Looks like a very functional dashboard.</p>
