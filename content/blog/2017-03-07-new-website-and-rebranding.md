Today is an exciting day for the Grafana project and for **raintank**, the company behind Grafana,
as we are launching a new website [grafana.com](https//grafana.com) and announcing the renaming of the
company to **Grafana Labs**. We are tired of saying *we are raintank, you know the company behind Grafana*.

To further simplify things we are combining our website's into one, meaning **grafana.org**, **grafana.net** and **raintank.io** are
all being combined to one new site on [grafana.com](https://grafana.com). This new site will provide Grafana downloads,
plugins & dashboard repositories, hosting services, forum & support services.

### What does this mean for Grafana

This has no real implications for Grafana as an OSS Project. It just means that the company behind it
is trying to simplify it's branding. We are still dedicated to keeping Grafana 100% open source.
We made the same mistake as many other open source companies, like MongoDB (previously named 10gen) and
Puppet (previously named Reductive Labs), in thinking that having a different company name and website defines some
measure of seperation from the OSS project and the company supporting it. We have realised that this seperation is just
confusing for everyone.

### Community Forum

Along with the launch of our new site we also launch [forum.grafana.com](http://forum.grafana.com). This new
forum will be Grafana's primary discussion channel for anything Grafana releated, meaning Grafana
support questions, plugin topics, TSDB related topics and other topics you might want to share
with the Grafana community.
