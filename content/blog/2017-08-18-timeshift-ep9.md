Matt from Grafana NYC spend the week in Stockholm working with Torkel on Grafana 5.0. Despite warnings otherwise, the weather has been mostly sunny, making a nice backdrop for non-stop discussions on new features. Very, very excited to soon show what we've been working on.

#### Grafana <3 Prometheus
Our very own Carl Bergquist spoke at PromCon 2017 yesterday in Munich, highlighting new enhancements and features for power users.
<p>We used the opportunity to debut our new Prometheus query editor with a load of new functionality; seems the community approves!

#### From the Blogosphere
- [**Wikimedia Metrics**](https://grafana.wikimedia.org): A tweet this week reminded us of the public metrics Wikimedia exposes using Grafana. Exploring the performance stats in real time for the 5th mot popular site on the internet is pretty fun. 

- [**Creating Grafana Annotations with InfluxDB**](https://maxchadwick.xyz/blog/grafana-influxdb-annotations): Nice short article by Max Chadwick showing how to quickly add InfluxDB as a source for Grafana annotations.

				ericslaw submitted his first PR to a public project this past week. Speaking from personal experiencing, submitting even the smallest PR can feel daunting, and and we were lucky that he chose Grafana. Even the smallest contributions, like Eric fixing a bogus link within our templating docs has big impact.

#### Tweet of the Week
We scour Twitter each week to find an interesting/beautiful dashboard and show it off! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monitoringlove?src=hash" target="_blank">#monitoringLove</a>
<p>Seems the excitement about Prometheus and Grafana has also caught the attention of a certain superhero.
