## GrafanaCon 2016

Last November we held the second GrafanaCon. This time it was actually a real conference and not a glorified meetup (Like GrafanaCon 2015).
It was a full two day conference, with over 200 attendees, 10 sponsors, 30 talks covering a diverse set
of topics from the Grafana ecosystem & user community. We also had an awesome and unique venue in the **USS Intrepid**
which is a aircraft carrier that has been turned into museum.

The event was big success, attendees & sponsors seemed happy, interesting talks and great after conference party. Was also great to meat some of the
big Grafana contributers like [Utkarsh Bhatnagar](https://github.com/utkarshcmu) and [Mitsuhiro Tanda](https://github.com/mtanda).

## Videos of Talks

Videos from all the talks are available on the official [Grafana Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYCwgQAMm9sTJv0rgwQLCxw).
There is a new [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDGkOdUX1Ujp_6OnJ8M-t59eGPs0rZF4Q) that contains all the talks.

Every attendee got a Grafana scarf. The most beautiful and useful peice of swag I have ever seen (but I may be a bit biased).

It was great getting the Grafana Labs team together for the event.
