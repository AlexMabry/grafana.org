Today is a momentus day for the Grafana project and for **raintank**, the company behind Grafana. We're rebranding as GrafanaLabs, and announcing something we've been working on for the better part of a year: GrafanaCloud.

First the rebrand: 

The growth and momentum of Grafana, and the popularity of the Grafana brand, has been unbelievable since we started raintank (indeed, accelerating the growth of Grafana is raintanks #1 mission). As we mentioned at [GrafanaCon](https://www.youtube), we're tired of saying *we are raintank, you know, the company behind Grafana?

So, raintank is now GrafanaLabs. 

To further simplify things we are combining our websites into one, meaning **grafana.org**, **grafana.net** and **raintank.io** are all being combined to one new site on [grafana.com](https://grafana.com). This new site will provide Grafana downloads,
plugins & dashboard repositories, forum & support, as well as our new GrafanaCloud offering. 

Introducing GrafanaCloud:

Over the last year, we've noticed a pattern with mawny our users. They enjoy using Grafana, but it's often frustrating and time-consuming to maintain their full monitoring stack. GrafanaCloud is our vision of SaaS monitoring, done in a completely open-source, and composable way. The initial components of GrafanaCloud are Hosted Grafana for analyzing your metrics, and Hosted Metrics to store and transform them.


### What does this mean for Grafana

This has no real implications for Grafana as an OSS project. It just means that the company behind it is trying to simplify its branding. 

We are still dedicated to keeping Grafana 100% open source. Accelerating core the Grafana project is one of the main reasons we sell things like Support Subscriptions, and have launched commercial offerings like GrafanaCloud.

In retrospect, we made the same mistake as many other open source companies. MongoDB (previously named 10gen), Puppet (previously named Reductive Labs), Docker (previously named dotcloud), Chef (previously named Opscode all serve as similar examples.

### Community Forum

Along with the launch of our new site we are also launching [forum.grafana.com](http://forum.grafana.com). This new
forum will be Grafana's primary discussion channel for anything Grafana releated, meaning Grafana
support questions, plugin topics, TSDB related discussion and other things you might want to share
with the Grafana community. This means we will close down the existing mailing list.

### What to expect in 2017

We have grand plans for this year. GrafanaLabs is now just about profitable, and we're on the hunt for additional funding (ie. a Series-A round) to help accelerate our vision.

Not only will we expand the core Grafana team, but we plan on making some highly-requested improvements to Grafana as well. The list of things we want to improve is too long to list here, but the first things we will focus on are the top rated issues: SQL Datasource support (Mysql & Postgress initially) and Dashboard folder & permissions. 

Parallel to core Grafana development we are also working on many premium plugins for commerical services like [Splunk](https://grafana.com/plugins/grafana-splunk-datasource),
[DataDog](https://grafana.com/plugins/grafana-datadog-datasource) and [HP Vertica](https://grafana.com/plugins/raintank-vertica-datasource). These Premium Plugins are available with all support subscriptions.
