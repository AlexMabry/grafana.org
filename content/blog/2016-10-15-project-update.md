## Grafana v4 Update

I know many are awaiting the next Grafana release, which will include the long anticipated alerting
feature. Beside data visualization we hope alerting will be a fundamental feature in Grafana. A feature that will
continue to evolve and improve for many years. That is why we have really taken the time get the core
design of the alerting rule an execution engine as solid as possible.

We are busily working on making a beta release by the end of October and stable release by end of November!
You can already try it out in the [nightly builds](http://grafana.org/builds/).
