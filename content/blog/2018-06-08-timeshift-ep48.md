### Welcome to TimeShift
We were in Portland this week attending Monitorama - one of our favorite annual conferences. We got the chance to catch up with old friends, make some new ones, and be part of an amazing community of passionate data and monitoring aficionados. Looking forward to Monitorama AMS in September!

Also this week we released Grafana v5.2.0-beta1 and... <strong>Elasticsearch alerting has arrived!</strong> Download it today and let us know what you think. Check out the specifics on the beta release below.

#### From the Blogosphere
[**GitLab's Github Importer Dashboard**](https://monitor.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/github-importer?orgId=1&from=now-30d&to=now): It's interesting to see the Github community's reaction to the Microsoft acquisition. In GitLab's public dashboard, you can the initial spike of Github projects being moved to GitLab following the announcement. It looks like it's starting to normalize, but will be fun to keep an eye on.

[**Prometheus and Grafana**](https://xincto.me/2018/05/prometheus-et-grafana.html): This is the third article in a series on spinning up your own Grafana and Prometheus monitoring stack. Part 1 covers the [principles of how Prometheus works](https://xincto.me/2018/05/prometheus-concepts-de-base.html), part 2 shows you how to [instrument your python code](https://xincto.me/2018/05/prometheus-bien-demarrer-en-python.html).

[**Automatic Data Source Configuration with Grafana 5**](https://www.unixdaemon.net/sysadmin/automatic-datasource-config-grafana-5/): A mini blog post on the new timesaving data source provisioning functionality in Grafana 5.

[**Quick Install of Prometheus, node_exporter and Grafana**](https://fritshoogland.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/quick-install-of-prometheus-node_exporter-and-grafana/): A short post on how to install Prometheus, node_exporter and Grafana in 3 steps using Ansible.

[**How to Install Grafana on Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian 9**](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-grafana-on-ubuntu-18-04-debian-9/): A quick guide to installing and configuring Grafana a few different ways; from the APT repo and via .deb packages.

[**Playing with Docker, MQTT, Grafana, InfluxDB, Python and Arduino**](https://gonzalo123.com/2018/06/04/playing-with-docker-mqtt-grafana-influxdb-python-and-arduino/): As an excuse to dive in and play with Grafana and InfluxDB, Gonzalo wanted to create a prototype of monitoring a sensor (in this example he used a simple potentiometer). He provides a step by step of his process, the source code and a video of the working prototype so you can build something similar.

				<strong>David Kaltschmidt - Grafana and Flux</strong><br />The new Influx Functional Query Language (now called Flux) super-charges queries both for analytics and data science. David will give a quick overview of the language features as well as the moving parts for a working deployment. Grafana is an open source dashboard solution that shares InfluxDataâ€™s passion for analytics and data science. For that reason, they are very excited to showcase the new Flux support within Grafana, and a couple of common analytics use cases to get the most out of your data.

				<strong>Jacob Lisi: What does Kubernetes Look Like? Performance Monitoring & Visualization with Grafana</strong> - Monitoring Kubernetes is vital to understanding the health and performance of a cluster, but which metrics are most important to add to your dashboards and alert on? Jacob will discuss how to most effectively monitor and visualize your Kubernetes cluster using the Grafana Kubernetes plugin and PromQL. Some of the topics of discussion include(1) how and what to collect when monitoring Kubernetes, (2) how to bring your Grafana dashboards to the next level by using Kubernetes as a data-source, and (3) what to do when managing multiple clusters. All of these topics and more will be discussed to help people get the most out of their Kubernetes monitoring.
