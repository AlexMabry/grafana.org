#### Grafana Plugins
This week we have an update to the Pie Chart Panel. We like to joke that [Friends don't let friends (ab)use pie charts](https://grafana.com/blog/2015/12/04/friends-dont-let-friends-abuse-pie-charts/), but sometimes they are the best tools for the job. It's easy to update Grafana plugins ‚Äì for on-prem Grafana, use the <a href="http://docs.grafana.org/administration/cli/#grafana-cli?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=timeshift_49" target="_blank">grafana-cli tool</a>, or for <a href="https://grafana.com/cloud/grafana?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=timeshift_49" target="_blank">Hosted Grafana</a> update with one-click.

				<br />
				<strong>Jacob Lisi: What does Kubernetes Look Like? Performance Monitoring & Visualization with Grafana</strong> - Monitoring Kubernetes is vital to understanding the health and performance of a cluster, but which metrics are most important to add to your dashboards and alert on? Jacob will discuss how to most effectively monitor and visualize your Kubernetes cluster using the Grafana Kubernetes plugin and PromQL. Some of the topics of discussion include(1) how and what to collect when monitoring Kubernetes, (2) how to bring your Grafana dashboards to the next level by using Kubernetes as a data-source, and (3) what to do when managing multiple clusters. All of these topics and more will be discussed to help people get the most out of their Kubernetes monitoring.
