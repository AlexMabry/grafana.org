**Current location/time zone:**
I'm in Vallentuna, 30 min. from Stockholm, CET.

**What do you do at Grafana Labs?**
I'm a fullstack developer on the Grafana team focusing on frontend.

**What open source projects do you contribute to?**
[Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana). I'm currently working on [Explore](https://grafana.com/docs/features/explore/) and making that an even better and more performant part of Grafana.

**What are your GitHub and Twitter handles?**
Left Twitter last year and so should everyone :) and my GitHub handle is @hugohaggmark.

**What do you like to do in your free time?**
I'm married since 2003 but we've been together since 1998, we've 3 kids, 19, 17 and 3, so most of my spare time is about the family and all the activities that come with that. I enjoy cooking, playing long RPG games like Fallout, snowboarding, and free diving/snorkeling.

**What’s your favorite new gadget or tech toy?**
The [IoT kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zRcE9n2RpE&feature=youtu.be) from the latest GrafanaCon.

**What's your ideal environment for coding?**
Depends, when I want 100% focus I'll listen to instrumental playlists like [this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0dyZStqklojJzyHGbgBcJB). Otherwise I enjoy hearing people around me.

**What do you do to get “in the zone” when you code?**
Turn off all notifications and noise-canceling headphones on.

**Which Game of Thrones character are you?**
Daenerys Targaryen.

**Spaces or tabs?**
Spaces of course. ;)
