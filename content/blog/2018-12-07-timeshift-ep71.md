### Welcome to TimeShift
We're excited to be speaking at and sponsoring KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2018 in Seattle next week and hope we get a chance to hang out. Swing by our booth to check out a new open source project we've been working on, and give us some feedback on Grafana and features you'd like to see. 

As always, we hope you enjoy this week's TimeShift, and don't be shy about telling us how we can make it better. Hope to see you in Seattle!

				<strong><a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/" target="_blank">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2018 | Seattle, WA - December 10-13, 2018</a>:</strong>
				<strong>David Kaltschmidt: On the OSS Path to Full Observability with Grafana</strong> - Grafana is coming &quot;off the wall&quot;. To make it more useful for interactive debugging, David and his team have already integrated two pillars of observability - metrics and logs. They are currently adding tracing to complete the incident response experience. All to minimize the cost of context switching during those crucial minutes after getting paged.
			</p>
			<p>
				This talk will demonstrate the various methods we&apos;ve used to link the data together. Prometheus is providing the metrics. Via its histograms, request latencies can be extracted to inform each tracing span from Jaeger. Grafana also ensures that lines from your log aggregation system are annotated with span and trace IDs, as well as the other way around: associating logged values with spans.
			</p>
			<p>
				David will show how these OSS parts should be deployed to achieve full observability in an engaging user experience that saves valuable minutes.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are also a proud sponsor of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's flagship conference. Join Kubernetes, Prometheus, Cortex, OpenTracing, Fluentd, gRPC, containerd, rkt, CNI, Envoy, Jaeger, Notary, TUF, Vitess, CoreDNS, NATS, Linkerd and Helm as the community gathers for four days to further the education and advancement of cloud native computing.
