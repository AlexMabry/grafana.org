[**Performance monitoring with ELK / Grafana**](https://blog.netapsys.fr/performance-monitoring-de-base-avec-elk-grafana/): This article walks you through setting up the ELK stack to monitor webpage load time, but switches out Kibana for Grafana so you can visualize data from other sources right next to this performance data.

[**ESXI Lab Series**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sua5WryY9a8): Aaron created a video mini-series about implementing both offensive and defensive security in an ESXi Lab environment. Parts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sua5WryY9a8" target="_blank">four</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dqeWnHF-pQ&t=3s" target="_blank">five</a> focus on monitoring with Grafana.

#### Grafana Plugins
We're always excited to announce updates to our existing plugins, and this week we have a bunch! Updating plugins is easy. If you have an on-prem Grafana, the <a href="http://docs.grafana.org/administration/cli/#grafana-cli?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=timeshift_12" target="_blank">Grafana-cli</a> will take care of the upgrade. For <a href="https://grafana.com/cloud/grafana?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=timeshift_12" target="_blank">Hosted Grafana</a>, use the one-click upgrade button.

<div class="blog-plugin">
	<div class="row row--md-gutters blog-plugin-grid">
		<div class="col col--sm-2 blog-plugin-grid__item">
			<img style="border-radius: 0;" src="https://grafana.com/api/plugins/vonage-status-panel/versions/1.0.5/logos/large" />
		</div>
		<div class="col col--sm-10 blog-plugin-grid__item">
			<p>
				<div class="updated-plugin-tag"><strong>UPDATED PLUGIN</strong></div><br/>
				<strong><a href="https://grafana.com/plugins/vonage-status-panel?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=timeshift_12" target="_blank">Status Panel</a></strong> - The Status Panel got a lot of updates in the latest version. Here are just some of them:
				<ul>
				<li>Added an option to use the default Grafana background rather than the green OK state color.</li>
				<li>Regex filtering bug fix</li>
				<li>Units of Measure, Decimals and Date formatting</li>
				<li>Ability to select preferred ok/warn/crit/disable colors and an option to apply coloring to either Background, Text or not at all.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				When upgrading there might be some changes in the data the plugin uses and saves, so some of the configurations you make might be removed by accident. To prevent this loss of configuration you should save the panel JSON of all panels you have (by exporting the panel or dashboards) and keep them somewhere safe until you made sure everything is working after the upgrade.
