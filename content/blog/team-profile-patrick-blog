**Current location/time zone:** 
I am in Stockholm, CET.

**What do you do at Grafana Labs?**
I work with UX/UI design and frontend development.

**What open source projects do you contribute to?**
I am contributing to the [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) project. Some of the things I am working on right now are designs for the new drilldown links and an epic for Grafana styling where we are migrating from scss to emotion, restyling components to fit in a 4px grid and cleaning out unused/unnecessary variables and classes. 

**What are your GitHub and Twitter handles?**
I don't use twitter. My GitHub handle is [ijin08](https://github.com/Ijin08).

**What do you like to do in your free time?**
In my free time I enjoy cooking, miniature wargaming, and swimming. But since becoming a father last fall a lot of it has been put on hold.

**What's your ideal environment for coding?**
If I really need to focus I prefer to code in silence.

**Which Game of Thrones character are you?**
Davos Seaworth.

**What's the last show you binged?**
*The Last Kingdom.* Fun show about Danes and Saxons fighting over England. The Danes' costumes do look silly though. 

**Spaces or tabs?**
Spaces.
